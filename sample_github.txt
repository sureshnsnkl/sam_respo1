5️⃣ What challenges do you face in processing sales data from multiple sources (SAP, POS, APIs)?
✅ Answer:

Schema mismatch: One source may have "customer_id", another "cust_id"

Timezone differences: Timestamps in different formats/zones

Late arriving data: Sales might arrive late from slow APIs

Duplicate data: Especially if APIs are polled multiple times

Different file formats: JSON, XML, CSV — need normalization

🛠 Use Delta Lake for schema evolution, Spark for transformation, and watermark logic to manage late data.
